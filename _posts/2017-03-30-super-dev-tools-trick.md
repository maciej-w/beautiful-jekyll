### Do you sometimes wonder how would a website or app look if you'd change the text or romove an element without updating HTML and reloading?

Open Console in Chrome - Ctrl + Shift + J on Windows Cmd + Shift + J on Mac

Type:  document.designMode = 'on'

Select text and start changing it directly clicking on website elements. You can delete images as well. Enjoy!
