### Recently I've been working on a project where a customer asked to sort user inputs by various rules and be able to insert future inputs as well.

We've been receiving messages with json objects which were sorted before inserting to a table but there was a possibility of adding new forms at the top of table (index 0 of Array).

Before needed only push and pop - so discovering unshift and shift was great :)

Lovely and easily explained:
