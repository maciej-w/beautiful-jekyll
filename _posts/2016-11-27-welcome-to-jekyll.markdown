Hi! My name is Maciej (but some friends call me Mac) and I'm a support developer. That means I help the
customers using our products (mDesign and [CommonTime] Infinity) to achieve what they want. Generally it
includes:
- Javascript
- SQL databases
- Azure
- Powershell
- and more

At home I try to code (having a 9 weeks old baby doesn't help) using Angular 2, Mongo, Firebase, some React.js and I've spent some time working with Xamarin.

I'll try to use this blog and post interesting solutions and what I learn while developing.
